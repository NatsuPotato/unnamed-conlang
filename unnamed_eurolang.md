## Pronouns

Pronouns have a special rule where they will cliticize onto following VP (if any).

3rd person pronouns are also demonstratives; they can stand in for English he, she, they, it, these, those, this, or that.

| Form | Meaning |
| mem | 1st |
| jen | 2nd |
| es  | 3rd proximate |
| as  | 3rd distal |
